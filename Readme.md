### What is this?

[@burnerbot](http://twitter.com/burnerbot) is a Twitter bot that uses [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) in an attempt to tweet hilarious shit. Every 4 hours, `twitter.php` executes via a cronjob to tweet to the @burnerbot account.

The two arrays in `events.php` were generated with Burning Man's [PlayaEvents API](http://playaevents.burningman.org/api/0.2/docs/). It is a collection of all the event names and camp names from 2009 - 2015.
